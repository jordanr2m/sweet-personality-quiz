# Author's Custom README Notes
**Title**: Super Sweet Personality Quiz
**Overview**: This is a short, candy-themed personality quiz. There are 4 different possible personality outcomes based on what answers the user chooses to the questions. 
    *Purpose*: I have always loved personality quizes and wanted to create my own. This is meant to be a fun way for users to learn more about themselves while answering somewhat silly questions. All of the questions and personality outcomes are my original conntent.
**Features**: This React app keeps track of the user's answers using a score state. Users cannot move from one question to the next without selecting an answer to each question. At the end of the quiz, the score is totalled, and the result is determined by the point range that the user's score falls within. Each of the 4 personality results has its own score range.
**Running this Project Locally**: You can find the repo to this project on GitHub here: https://github.com/jordanr2m/sweet-personality-quiz
    1. Clone the project from Github
    2. Run npm install in command line to initialize it as a React project
    3. Run npm start in the command line to run the project locally
    4. Take the quiz and see what candy you are!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
